## Case report: Facial nerve paralysis

Male, 42 years old. Visited on March 3, 2025.

The patient reported initially experiencing pain in the right neck and shoulder, which later shifted to the left side, accompanied by pain in the forehead and facial paralysis on the left side. He had previously undergone examinations and medication treatment at a hospital.

Additional symptoms:
Four years ago, he strained his lower back while lifting heavy objects, resulting in four years of low back pain. He also experienced lower abdominal bloating and pain, constipation, insomnia, facial flushing, and red eyes. After physical labor, he tends to drink alcohol and eat spicy food.

Physical examination:

Incomplete closure of the left eye

Drooping of the left corner of the mouth

Weakness in the left facial muscles

Tension in the neck and shoulder muscles

Poor neck mobility

Straightening of the lumbar curve

Tense lumbar muscles

Lumbar vertebral misalignment

Diagnosis:

Cervicogenic facial nerve paralysis

Lumbar facet joint disorder

Heat-induced constipation

Treatment:
After 9 sessions of massage, spinal adjustment, and gua sha therapy on the neck, shoulders, upper back, and lower back, the facial paralysis and low back pain improved significantly. Abdominal bloating and constipation improved after 3 days of taking traditional Chinese medicine. The patient was advised to reduce alcohol consumption, avoid spicy food, and increase intake of vegetables and fruits.
