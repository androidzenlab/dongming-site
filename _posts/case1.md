## Case report: Lumbar pain with sciatica

Male, painter. First visit in 2013.
Chief complaint: Lower back pain, numbness and pain in the left leg, weakness, and inability to stand on one leg.
The patient had previously visited Wellington Hospital, where he underwent X-rays and other examinations, and received treatment including medication and physical therapy.

Physical examination: Limited lumbar mobility, tense lumbar muscles, left straight leg raise test approximately 40 degrees, tenderness at L4 on the left side with positive radiating pain, and weakened dorsiflexion strength of the left big toe.

Diagnosis: Lumbar disc herniation at L4-L5.

Treatment: After approximately 15 sessions of lumbar spinal adjustment, therapeutic massage, and external application of traditional Chinese medicine, all symptoms significantly improved. As of June 2025, the patient continues to work normally in painting without recurrence.

About six months after his back and leg symptoms improved, the patient developed facial nerve paralysis. He underwent examinations at a hospital, but no cause was found. He later visited again with the hospital’s diagnosis report.

Upon examination, the patient had tight muscles in the neck, shoulders, and upper back, limited neck and shoulder mobility, and cervical misalignment with tenderness.

Diagnosis: Cervicogenic facial nerve paralysis.

Treatment: Through neck and shoulder massage, cervical spinal adjustment, facial acupoint scraping (gua sha), and external application of traditional Chinese medicine, the condition improved. As of June 2025, there has been no recurrence.
